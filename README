chrome extension for netflix request

Mac OS
=====
1. Since Chrome 17, the webRequest API has been moved to stable, so no more experimental api flag is needed, just run chrome normally would be fine
"/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome"

2. download the extension in chrome, and it will automatically be installed:
